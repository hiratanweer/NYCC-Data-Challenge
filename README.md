NYC Council Data Scientist Exercise

Hypothetical Scenario:

A staffer from the Councilâ€™s Public Safety Committee is preparing a briefing paper and
questions for a hearing on NYPD arrests. They are interested in knowing if the arrest rate
has decreased, understanding overall trends in arrests, and what we can say about police
enforcement in the city. They have approached you, as a member of the Data team, for
an analysis of arrests from 2019-2024.


About the NYPD Arrests Data Set (Historic):

The NYPD Arrests Data Set (Historic) provides incident-level data related to arrests in
NYC, including the type of crime, location, time of enforcement, and suspect
demographics, as noted on the Open Data Portal. The data and metadata can be
accessed below.

a. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u/about_data

b. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc/about_data

Deliverables:

Validate, clean, and analyze the NYPD data set. Answer the following questions in a report
of 2-3 pages (excluding figures).

1. Arrest Rate Trend: Has the arrest rate decreased from 2019 to 2024? Describe the
trend and justify any statistical tests used.

2. Top 5 Arrests: Identify the top 5 most frequent arrests in the 'pd_desc' column
from 2019-2024. Describe and compare the trends over time.

3. Crime Comparison: Is there more crime in Precinct 19 (Upper East Side) compared
to Precinct 73 (Brownsville), using arrests as a sample? Describe the trend and
variability, and justify any statistical tests used.

4. Predictive Model: Propose a model to predict crime for better resource allocation
by the NYPD. Discuss potential challenges, the choice of independent and
dependent variables, and how you would evaluate the model.

Clearly explain and justify any assumptions, statistical tests, plots, and models you use.
Feel free to use external publicly available datasets and include any exploratory data
analysis that adds value to the analysis. You may use any programming language you are
comfortable with, preferably R or Python.
